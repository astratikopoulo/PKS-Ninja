# PKS Backup and Restore using Velero

## Overview

### Velero
 - Velero (formerly Heptio Ark) gives you tools to back up and restore your Kubernetes cluster resources and persistent volumes. 

 - Velero Feature
   Take backups of your cluster and restore in case of loss.
   Copy cluster resources to other clusters.
   Backup and restore PV's
   Scheduled Backups
   Replicate your production environment for development and testing environments.
   Filtering (namespaces, resources, label selectors)
   Restore into different namespaces

- Velero Extensibility
  Hooks
  Plugins

- Velero consists of:
  A server that runs on your cluster
  A command-line client that runs locally

### Persistent Volumes 
  In this sample , Velero leverages vSphere Storage for Kubernetes to allow Minio to use enterprise grade persistent storage to store the backup.
  Persistent volumes requested by stateful containerized applications can be provisioned on vSAN, iSCSI, VVol, VMFS or NFS datastores.

  Kubernetes volumes are defined in Pod specifications. They reference VMDK files and these VMDK files are mounted as volumes when the container is running. When the Pod is deleted the Kubernetes volume is unmounted and the data in VMDK files persists.
  
  PKS deploys Kubernetes clusters with the vSphere storage provider already configured. 

  In order to use Persistent Volumes (PV) the user needs to create a PersistentVolumeClaim(PVC) which is nothing but a request for PVs. A claim must specify the access mode and storage capacity, once a claim is created PV is automatically bound to this claim. Kubernetes will bind a PV to PVC based on access mode and storage capacity but a claim can also mention volume name, selectors and volume class for a better match. This design of PV-PVCs not only abstracts storage provisioning and consumption but also ensures security through access control.

  Static Persistent Volumes require that a vSphere administrator manually create a (virtual disk) VMDK on a datastore, then create a Persistent Volume that abstracts the VMDK. A developer would then make use of the volume by specifying a Persistent Volume Claim.

  Dynamic Volume Provisioning
  With PV and PVCs one can only provision storage statically i.e. PVs first needs to be created before a Pod claims it. However, with the StorageClass API Kubernetes enables dynamic volume provisioning. This avoids pre-provisioning of storage and storage is provisioned automatically when a user requests it. The VMDK's are also cleaned up when the Persistent Volume Claim is removed.

  The StorageClass API object specifies a provisioner and parameters which are used to decide which volume plugin should be used and which provisioner specific parameters to configure.

1.2 ssh to the cli-vm and download and uncompress the Velero distribution 
  
```bash
mkdir velero
cd ~/velero
wget https://github.com/heptio/velero/releases/download/v1.1.0-beta.1/velero-v1.1.0-beta.1-linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar xvf velero-v1.1.0-beta.1-linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

## Step 2:  Validate the planespotter app

2.1 Login to pks witht he command , when prompted use the password as VMware1!

```bash
pks login -a pks.corp.local -u pksadmin --skip-ssl-validation
```


2.2 Pull down the kubernetes config and credentials for my-cluster with the command 

```bash
pks get-credentials my-cluster
```

2.3 Verify all the pods needed for the planespotter app - front-end, redis, DBC Sync services and App server (7 total) have been deployed and have entered Running state

```bash
kubectl get pods --namespace planespotter

kubectl get services --namespace planespotter
```

## Step 3:  Setup Minio

3.1 Set up prerequisites necessary to run the Velero server
    Delete any existing velero namespaces , clusterbindings and crds 


```bash
kubectl delete namespace/velero clusterrolebinding/velero
kubectl delete crds -l component=velero

kubectl create ns velero
```

3.2 Now let us set our context to the namespace velero 

```bash
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=velero
```


3.3 Create a Velero-specific credentials file (credentials-velero) in your local directory


```bash
cd ~/velero/velero-v1.1.0-beta.1-linux-amd64
```

<details><summary>credentials-velero</summary>

```yaml
[default]
aws_access_key_id = minio
aws_secret_access_key = minio123
```

</details>
<br/>

3.4 We are setting up a PV that velero can use to store the backups.
    Create a Storage Class. Create a 000-storage-class.yaml file and copy the below contents into it, save and exit.  

```bash
cd  ~/velero/velero-v1.1.0-beta.1-linux-amd64/examples/minio

nano 000-storage-class.yaml
```

<details><summary>000-storage-class.yaml</summary>

```yaml
---
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: minio-disk
provisioner: kubernetes.io/vsphere-volume
parameters:
    diskformat: thin
```

</details>
<br/>

```bash
kubectl apply -f 000-storage-class.yaml

```

3.5 Create a Persistent Volume Claim . Create a 001-velero-pvc.yaml file and copy the below contents into it, save and exit. 

```bash
nano 001-velero-pvc.yaml

```

<details><summary>01-velero-pvc.yaml</summary>

```yaml

```

</details>
<br/>


```bash
kubectl apply -f 001-velero-pvc.yaml

```

3.6 Login to vCenter to and check if the PV has been provisioned under kubevols

3.8 Create the minio deployment

```bash
kubectl apply -f 00-minio-deployment.yaml
```

3.9 Check  the minio services and pods 

```bash
kubectl get po
kubectl get services
```
<details><summary>Screenshot 3.9</summary>
<img src="Images/miniostatus.png">
</details>
<br/>


3.10 Expose the minio with the following command

```bash
kubectl expose deployment minio --name=velero-minio-lb --port=9000 --target-port=9000 --type=LoadBalancer --namespace=velero

```

3.11 Check the external URL/IP address assigned to the service (make note of the first IP addres under External-IP).

```bash
kubectl get service velero-minio-lb -n velero

```
<details><summary>Screenshot 3.11</summary>

<br/>

3.12 Copy the IP under the "External-IP" section . Point your browser to that location <external-ip>:9000. You should be able to view the minio browser

<details><summary>Screenshot 3.12</summary>
<img src="Images/minioip.png">
</details>
<br/>


3.13 Start the server and the local storage service. Velero does not support vSphere currently so we are going to be using Restic. We will also be supplying the credentials file for minio that we created in the previous step. We will also be proividing the url to the minio service that we exposed as a loadbalancer in the previous step.



```bash
cd ~/velero/velero-v1.1.0-beta.1-linux-amd64

./velero install \
     --provider aws \
     --bucket velero \
     --secret-file ./credentials-velero \
     --use-volume-snapshots=false \
     --use-restic \
     --backup-location-config region=minio,s3ForcePathStyle="true",s3Url=http://minio.velero.svc:9000,publicUrl=http://10.40.14.43:9000
```

<details><summary>Screenshot 3.13</summary>

<br/>

3.14 Check status of the installation


```bash
kubectl get po
kubectl get deployments

```

<details><summary>Screenshot 3.14</summary>
<img src="Images/veleroinstallcheck.png">
</details>
<br/>

Note : If the restic pods fail to start do the following


```bash
kubectl edit daemonset restic -n velero
```
change hostPath from /var/lib/kubelet/pods to /var/vcap/data/kubelet/pods:

Which will look like below

```yaml
      - hostPath:
          path: /var/vcap/data/kubelet/pods

```


## Step 4:  Backup

4.1 Point your browser to that location <external-ip>:9000. You should be able to view the minio browser. Login as Access Key as minio and Secret Key as minio123

<Details><Summary>Screenshot 4.1</Summary>
<img src="Images/miniologin.png">

<br/>


4.2 SSH into cli-vm 
  
```bash

cd ~/velero

```

NOTE: Steps 4.3 aand 4.4 are optional and require to be used for PV's / Stateful applications

4.3 Run the following to annotate each pod that contains a volume to back up
  
```bash

kubectl -n YOUR_POD_NAMESPACE annotate pod/YOUR_POD_NAME backup.velero.io/backup-volumes=YOUR_VOLUME_NAME_1,YOUR_VOLUME_NAME_2,...

```

4.4 Run the following to get the pod's that are running in the planespotter namespace
  
```bash

kubectl get pods --namespace planespotter

```


4.5 For the planespotter app , mysql is the stateful pod that would need to be annotated. (Valumes from mysql_pod.yaml in the planespotter app)
 
```bash

kubectl -n planespotter annotate pod/<mysql pod name from 4.3 eg. mysql-0> backup.velero.io/backup-volumes=mysql-vol,mysql-config,mysql-start

```

4.6 Take a backup of the planespotter namespace. The backup will be called planes

```bash

./velero backup create planes --include-namespaces planespotter

```


4.7 Valero will prompt the following . Check the status of the backup using the commands below

```bash

Backup request "planes" submitted successfully.
Run `./velero backup describe planes` or `velero backup logs planes` for more details.

```

4.8 Refresh the minio browser annd you will be able to view the backup that was created by velero. Velero creates a set of tar.gz files as backup.
